\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

All living creatures constantly interact with the environment. To
understanding individual animals, we have to understand the relationship
they have with their environment. Also, animals affect the environment.
From birth to death, an animal generates carbon dioxide, methane, feces,
and urine. The excretes from the animal are built with molecules such as
carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, and are recycled within and
between ecosystems.

\chapter{Animal and environment}\label{chapter2}

\section{External environment}\label{external-environment}

Animal never separates from the stimuli from outside. Basically, animals
can find food, shelter, protection, and mates from the environment
called \emph{habitat}. The animal habitat includes both phisical
(non-living) and biotic (livinig) components (Table \ref{tab:habitat}).

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{\label{tab:habitat}Components of habitat (physical and biotic)}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
Physical & Biotic\\
\midrule
Temperature & Plant matter\\
Humidity & Predators\\
Oxygen & Parasites\\
Wind & Competitors\\
Soil & Individuals of the same species\\
\addlinespace
Light intensity & \\
Elevation & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Animal habitat is constantly changed over time. Not only natural
disasters (eruption of volcano, earthquake, tsunami, and wildfire), also
human activity can affect the animal habitat. Unlike the wildlife, the
environment of domesticated animals (such as cow, pig, poultry, and dog)
that raised in the facility are controlled by the human. In the domestic
animals, the external environment includes both physical (e.g.~housing,
feeder, paddock, fence, and noise) and biotic (e.g.~human, mate, and
feed ingredients) components. Because it's a very huge field, this book
can't cover every topic of both wildlife and domesticated animal. Thus,
from now on, we will deal with the topic for the domesticated animal.

\section{Internal environment}\label{internal-environment}

\begin{quote}
``The living body, though it has need of the surrounding environment, is
nevertheless relatively independent of it.'' --- Claude Bernard
\end{quote}

Higher animals have complex systems that respond to stimuli to perform
their essential body functions. When the animal receives the signals
from the sensory organs, they produce a local reflex action and/or react
in the central nervous system. Weak signals produce no responses, but
strong stimuli change the physiological or behavioral status of the
animal.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/animal-env} 

}

\caption{External and internal environment}\label{fig:ext-int-env}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Shelford's law of
tolerance}\label{shelfords-law-of-tolerance}

\begin{quote}
``Each and every species is able to exist and reproduce successfully
only within a definite range of environmental conditions.'' --- Ronald
Good
\end{quote}

Although external environments are continuously changed, if animals in
the normal status, they keep the composition of the extracellular fluid
(internal environment) constant to maintain their life. We call it
\emph{homeostasis}.

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{\label{tab:homeostasis}List of homeostatic control variables}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
\toprule
Control variables\\
\midrule
Core temperature; Blood glucose; Iron levels; Copper regulation; Levels of blood gases;\\
Blood oxygen content; Arterial blood pressure; Calcium levels; Sodium concentration;\\
Potassium concentration; Fluid balance; Blood pH; Cerebrospinal fluid; Neurotransmission;\\
Neuroendocrine system; Gene regulation; and Energy balance\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

However, the capacity to maintain the homeostasis is broken when the
animals let the harsh environments and differ by their species.
\textbf{Animals may be limited in their growth and their occurrence by
the minimum, maximum, and optimum condition} \citep{shelford} (Fig.
\ref{fig:law-of-tol}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{AES_files/figure-latex/law-of-tol-1} 

}

\caption{Shelford's law of tolerance}\label{fig:law-of-tol}
\end{figure}

The optimum range of environmental condition may differ within the same
organism, and it is not necessarily fixed. They can change as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Change of seasons
\item
  Change of environmental conditions
\item
  Life stage of the organism
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adaptation}\label{adaptation}

\begin{quote}
``Changes in morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and
behavioral characteristics of the animal which promote welfare and favor
survival in a specific environment.'' --- Hafez
\end{quote}

\citet{hafez1968adaptation} defined an adaptation as above. The
adaptation helps an animal survive in their external environment. The
representative adaptive traits are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Structural adaptation
\item
  Behavioral adaptation
\item
  Physiological adaptation
\end{enumerate}

Structural adaptation is the changes in physical features (e.g.~body
shape, skin, and internal organs) of the animal. Behavioral adaptation
is the changes in behaviors (e.g.~searching for food, mating,
vocalizations, and mitigation) of the animal. Physiological adaptation
is the changes in the animal body functions such as growth, temperature
regulation, and ionic balance. Sometimes, adapted animal create a new
species (\emph{speciation}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/adaptation} 

}

\caption{Migration is an example of a behavioral adaptation. Grey whales swim from the Arctic to Mexico every year.}\label{fig:adaptation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Acclimatization}\label{acclimatization}

Acclimatization is the physiological changes induced by a complex of
factors such as altitude, temperature, humidity, photoperiod, or pH.
Acclimatization is the short-term process (hours to weeks) by comparison
with adaptation (take place over many generations).

\chapter{Temperature}\label{temperature}

Temperature is a quantity expressing of the amount of heat. Because a
rate of every chemical reaction occurs in the animal's body is affected
by the temperature, it is a very important factor to all animals. Like
most chemical reactions, an enzyme-catalyzed reaction rate in the
animal's body increases as the temperature is raised. However, extremely
high or low temperature results in loss of activity or lose the
structure for most enzymes (\emph{denaturation}; Figure \ref{fig:q10}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/q10} 

}

\caption{The effects of temperature on enzyme activity [@q10]. Top - increasing temperature increases the rate of reaction (Q10 coefficient). Middle - the fraction of folded and functional enzyme decreases above its denaturation temperature. Bottom - consequently, an enzyme's optimal rate of reaction is at an intermediate temperature.}\label{fig:q10}
\end{figure}

\section{Poikilotherm and homeotherm}\label{poikilotherm-and-homeotherm}

Key factors for animal surviving are to adapt to external environmental
changes and maintain a consistent internal environment. The animal can
be divided into two types for response to external temperatures:
\emph{poikilotherm} (cold-blooded animals) and \emph{homeotherm}
(warm-blooded animals). Examples of poikilotherms are most fish,
amphibians, and reptiles. Their internal body temperature varies
considerably according to their external environments. On the other
hand, homeotherm maintains their thermal homeostasis regardless of the
external temperature. The examples of homeotherm are birds and mammals.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{AES_files/figure-latex/body-temp-comparision-1} 

}

\caption{Comparison of body temperature response by snake (poikiloterm) and bobcat (homeoterm) to changing ambient temperature.}\label{fig:body-temp-comparision}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Poikilotherm}\label{poikilotherm}

The term derives from the acient Greek language \emph{poikilos}
(œÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒªŒøœÇ; changeable) and \emph{thermos} (Œ∏ŒµœÅŒºœåœÇ; heat). The body
temperature of poikilotherms varies considerably than those of
homeotherms (Figure \ref{fig:body-temp-comparision}). They generally use
solar radiation for maintaining their body temperature and have four to
ten enzyme systems that can operate at different ambient temperature
because the temperature affects the chemical reactions.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/flog} 

}

\caption{Green frog on blue surface.}\label{fig:flor}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Homeoterm}\label{homeoterm}

Homeotherms can maintain body temperature independently from ambient
temperatures by regulating the metabolic process. They preserve their
body temperature by muscle contraction and brown adipose tissue is
catabolized for heat production \citep{grigg2004evolution}. In hot
environments, they use evaporative cooling (sweating or panting) for
maintaining their body temperature. Most of the domestic animals are
homeotherm.

In some homeoterms (bears, hedgehog, marmot, and so on) and
poikilotherms (frogs, turtles, snake, and so on), they can enter the
\emph{hibernation} in the cold season: the body temperature is dropped,
and the metabolic rate is depressed. Hibernating bears can recycle their
body proteins and urine to avoid muscle loss.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/kimetal} 

}

\caption{Infrared cameras image that cows generating the heats. @kim2018image developed the algorithms for tracking the cows using IR camera video.}\label{fig:kimetal}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Heterotherm}\label{heterotherm}

Heterotherms exhibit the characteristics of both poikilotherm and
homeotherm. They can switch between poikilothermic and homeothermic
strategies. In some bat species, for example, body temperature and
metabolic rate are elevated only when they are active. When they at
rest, metabolic rate is drastically dropped thereby the body temperature
is decreased to the ambient temperature.

\section{Thermoregulation}\label{thermoregulation}

Thermoregulation is a process to maintain the internal temperature
within certain boundaries. In homeotherms, thermoregulatory physiology
is mainly controlled by nervous and endocrine systems. The core
temperature of the animal is primarily regulated by the hypothalamus. If
the ambient temperature is going to cold, they generate heat via
metabolic processes to keep their body temperature. In contrast, in hot
conditions, sweat glands release sweat for evaporates and the blood
vessels going to wider for increasing the blood flow to the skin.

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{\label{tab:norm-body-temp}Normal body temperature of the domestic animals; Body temperatures may be 1¬∞C above or below these temperatures.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
Animal & Normal temperature (¬∞C) & Animal & Normal temerature (¬∞C)\\
\midrule
Cattle & 38.5 & Donkey & 38.2\\
Calf & 39.5 & Chicken & 42.0\\
Buffalo & 38.2 & Camel & 34.5-41.0\\
Sheep & 39.0 & Horse & 38.0\\
Llama, alpaca & 38.0 & Pig & 39.0\\
\addlinespace
Goat & 39.5 & Piglet & 39.8\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In poikilotherms, they use external sources of temperature to keep their
body temperatures (Table \ref{tab:cooling}). To regulate their body
temperature, they sometimes climbing the trees, entering the warm water,
lying on the cool ground, or lying in the sun. There are some methods
for thermoregulation in poikilotherms: \emph{convection},
\emph{conduction}, and \emph{radiation}. Convection is the transfer of
heat via the movement of molecules within fluids (gases or liquids).
Conduction is the transfer of heat via the direct molecular collision.
Radiation is the transfer of heat in the form of waves or particles
(sunlight is the most familiar forms of radiation). Once there's a
thermal equilibrium between the animal and environment, the thermal
exchange will be stopped.

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{\label{tab:cooling}Cooling and heating methods for poikilotherms}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Methods & Cooling & Heating\\
\midrule
Convection & Increasing blood flow to body surfaces & Entering a warm water or air current; Building an insulated nest or burrow\\
Conduction & Lying on cool ground; Staying wet in a river, lake or sea; Covering in cool mud & Lying on a hot surface\\
Radiation & Get away from the sun & Lying in the sun; Folding skin to reduce exposure\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

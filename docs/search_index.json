["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction All living creatures constantly interact with the environment. To understanding individual animals, we have to understand the relationship they have with their environment. Also, animals affect the environment. From birth to death, animals generate carbon dioxide, methane, feces, and urine. The excretes from animals are builded with molecules such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, and are recycled within and between ecosystems. Basically, animals can find food, shelter, protection, and mates from the environment called habitat. The animal habitat includes both phisical (non-living) and biotic (livinig) components (see Table 1.1). Table 1.1: Components of habitat (physical and biotic) Physical Biotic Temperature Plant matter Humidity Predators Oxygen Parasites Wind Competitors Soil Individuals of the same species Light intensity Elevation Animal habitat is constantly changed over time. Not only natural disasters (eruption of volcano, earthquake, tsunami, and wildfire), also human activity can affect the animal habitat. Unlike the wildlife, the environment of domesticated animals (such as cow, pig, poultry, and dog) that raised in the facility are controlled by the human. Because it’s a very huge field, this book can’t cover every topic of both wildlife and domesticated animal. Thus, from now on, we will deal with the topic for the domesticated animal.

In the domestic animals, the external environment includes both physical (e.g. housing, feeder, paddock, fence, and noise) and biotic (e.g. human, mate, and feed ingredients) components like those of animal habitat 1. Figure 2.1: External and internal environment 2.2 Internal environment “The living body, though it has need of the surrounding environment, is nevertheless relatively independent of it.” — Claude Bernard Higher animals have complex organ systems that respond to stimuli to perform their essential body functions. When the animal receives the signals from the sensory organs, they produce a local reflex action and/or react in the central nervous system. Weak signals produce no responses, but strong stimuli change the physiological or behavioral status of the animal. 2.2.1 Shelford’s law of tolerance “Each and every species is able to exist and reproduce successfully only within a definite range of environmental conditions.” — Ronald Good Although external environments are continuously changed, if animals in the normal status, they keep the composition of the extracellular fluid (internal environment) constant to maintain their life. We call it homeostasis. Table 2.1: List of homeostatic control variables Control variables Core temperature; Blood glucose; Iron levels; Copper regulation; Levels of blood gases; Blood oxygen content; Arterial blood pressure; Calcium levels; Sodium concentration; Potassium concentration; Fluid balance; Blood pH; Cerebrospinal fluid; Neurotransmission; Neuroendocrine system; Gene regulation; and Energy balance However, the capacity to maintain the homeostasis is broken when the animals let the harsh environments and differ by their species. Animals may be limited in their growth and their occurrence by the minimum, maximum, and optimum condition (Shelford 1931) (Fig. 2.2). Figure 2.2: Shelford’s law of tolerance The optimum range of environmental condition may differ within the same organism, and it is not necessarily fixed. They can change as: Change of seasons Change of environmental conditions Life stage of the organism 2.2.2 Adaptation “Changes in morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and behavioral characteristics of the animal which promote welfare and favor survival in a specific environment.” — Hafez Hafez and others (1968) defined an adaptation as above. The adaptation helps an animal survive in their external environment. The representative adaptive traits are: Structural adaptation Behavioral adaptation Physiological adaptation Structural adaptation is the changes in physical features (e.g. body shape, skin, and internal organs) of the animal. Behavioral adaptation is the changes in behaviors (e.g. searching for food, mating, vocalizations, and mitigation) of the animal. Physiological adaptation is the changes in the animal body functions such as growth, temperature regulation, and ionic balance. Sometimes, adapted animal create a new species (speciation). Figure 2.3: Migration is an example of a behavioral adaptation. Grey whales swim from the Arctic to Mexico every year. 2.2.3 Acclimatization Acclimatization is the physiological changes induced by a complex of factors such as altitude, temperature, humidity, photoperiod, or pH. Acclimatization is the short-term process (hours to weeks) by comparison with adaptation (take place over many generations). References "],

Because a rate of every chemical reaction occurs in the animal’s body is affected by the temperature, it is a very important factor to all animals. Like most chemical reactions, an enzyme-catalyzed reaction rate in the animal’s body increases as the temperature is raised. However, extremely high or low temperature results in loss of activity or lose the structure for most enzymes (denaturation; Figure 3.1). Figure 3.1: The effects of temperature on enzyme activity (Shafee 2016). Top - increasing temperature increases the rate of reaction (Q10 coefficient). Middle - the fraction of folded and functional enzyme decreases above its denaturation temperature. Bottom - consequently, an enzyme’s optimal rate of reaction is at an intermediate temperature. 3.1 Poikilotherm and homeotherm Key factors for animal surviving are to adapt to external environmental changes and maintain a consistent internal environment. The animal can be divided into two types for response to external temperatures: poikilotherm (cold-blooded animals) and homeotherm (warm-blooded animals). Examples of poikilotherms are most fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Their internal body temperature varies considerably according to their external environments. On the other hand, homeotherm maintains their thermal homeostasis regardless of the external temperature. The examples of homeotherm are birds and mammals. Figure 3.2: Green frog on blue surface. 3.1.1 Poikilotherm The term derives from the acient Greek language poikilos (ποικίλος; changeable) and thermos (θερμός; heat). The body temperature of poikilotherms varies considerably than those of homeotherms (Figure 3.3). They generally use solar radiation for maintaining their body temperature and have four to ten enzyme systems that can operate at different ambient temperature because the temperature affects the chemical reactions. 3.1.2 Homeoterm Homeotherms can maintain body temperature independently from ambient temperatures by regulating the metabolic process. They preserve their body temperature by muscle contraction and brown adipose tissue is catabolized for heat production (Grigg, Beard, and Augee 2004). In hot environments, they use evaporative cooling (sweating or panting) for maintaining their body temperature. Most of the domestic animals are homeotherm. In some homeoterms (bears, hedgehog, marmot, and so on) and poikilotherms (frogs, turtles, snake, and so on), they can enter the hibernation in the cold season: the body temperature is dropped, and the metabolic rate is depressed. Hibernating bears can recycle their body proteins and urine to avoid muscle loss. Figure 3.3: Comparison of body temperature response by snake (poikiloterm) and bobcat (homeoterm) to changing ambient temperature. 3.1.3 Heterotherm Heterotherms exhibit the characteristics of both poikilotherm and homeotherm. They can switch between poikilothermic and homeothermic strategies. In some bat species, for example, body temperature and metabolic rate are elevated only when they are active. When they at rest, metabolic rate is drastically dropped thereby the body temperature is decreased to the ambient temperature. 3.2 Thermoregulation Thermoregulatory physiology is mainly controlled by nervous and endocrine systems. Table 3.1: Normal body temperature of the domestic animals; Body temperatures may be 1°C above or below these temperatures.

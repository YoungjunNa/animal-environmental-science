**Air quality is the degree of pollution of air.** The air quality can be determined by measuring the concentration of pollutants in the air. Air quality has a direct influence on health, welfare and production performance of livestock. The high concentrations of noxious gases, dust, and airborne microorganisms can reduce the production efficiency and the general welfare of farm animals. Long term exposure to particulates in livestock buildings might also affect the respiratory health of farm workers. Dust in animal buildings contains many biologically active substances such as bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins that are suspected to be hazardous to human health.

Airborne emissions include ammonia, methane, nitrous oxide, particulates like dust and microorganisms. In addition, other potentially harmful substances such as heavy metals, antibiotic residues and components of disinfectants might be also emitted from livestock building that are potentially damaging to ecosystems.

## Importance of air quality
Animals that continually exposed to bad air quality had reduced productivity and increased the stress. Maintaining good air quality is not only important for the productivity of the animals, but also for the welfare of the animals. 

**There are some benefits of improving the air quality:**  
1. Improves the health, welfare and production performance of the animals.  
2. Improves the health and safety of producers and workers.  
3. Reduces emissions of harmful pollutants to the outside environment which helps reduce nuisance complaints.  
4. Results in significant energy and economic savings.  
5. Prolongs the life of building structures.  

Generally air quality is affected by weather, livestock facilities and management conditions. Air quality is getting worse during light wind conditions, as pollutants cannot be blown away. 

## Pollutants

### Ammonia  
Ammonia is emitted from manure in livestock buildings, manure storage facilities and during manure application to soils. Ammonia in livestock facilities results primarily from the breakdown of urea (present in urine) by the enzyme urease (excreted in feces). Typical ammonia levels in well-ventilated buildings are 10 to 20 ppm. Ammonia can be easily removed from livestock buildings by proper ventilation because it is lighter than air.

#### Suppression methods
1. Decreasing of the length of the time manure remained.
2. Keeping buildings and the animals clean and dry.
3. Separation manure from urine.
4. Using acidifying agents to suppress ammonia emissions from manure.
5. Manipulating dietary crude protein types and levels.
6. Filtration.  
7. Landscaping: Trees, shrubs and other vegetative barriers planted around livestock buildings have the potential of reducing ammonia emissions.

### Hydrogen sulphide
Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas and has potential to cause health problems if the concentration becomes too high. Hydrogen sulphide is heavier than air, soluble in water, and can accumulate in the livestock buildings. It has a rotten-egg odour and it can be easily detected at low concentrations.

#### Suppression methods
- Modifying swine diets to balance rations reduce hydrogen sulphide emissions.
- Frequent removal of manure from static pits significantly reduces hydrogen sulphide.
- Physical, chemical and biological treatment of stored manure such as manure additives and oil sprinkling.
- Biofiltration is an effective method for reducing the emissions of hydrogen sulphide.

### Particulate matters (Dust)
The particulates matter (PM) originate from either the feed, bedding/ manure/litter, or the animal itself (Seedorf and Hartung, 2000). Particles are globally classified as coarse (>2.5 μm in diameter) and fine (<2.5 μm in diameter), with those between 0.50 and 5 μm considered especially damaging to the lungs (Hinds, 1982).

##
- **Water is a critical nutrient for animal**. 
- An adequate and safe water supply is essential to the production of healthy animals. 
- From transportation to lubrication to temperature regulation, water keeps animal life functioning. 
- All chemical reactions in the bodies of animals use water as a medium.

## Water has the functions in the animal's body as:

1. Temperature regulation: Water acts as a buffer against overheating due to water's high specific heat.  
2. pH regulation: When the water introduced into an animal's system, it brings the pH closer to a neutral value.  
3. Hydrolysis and energy production  
4. Digestion  
5. Joint lubrication  

##
- Measurements of water quality and quantity are required for effective planning and monitoring of water supplies for livestock. 
- **If water quality is poor, livestock may drink less than they need or, rarely, may stop drinking.** 
- When animals drink less, they will eat less and lose condition and if they are lactating, their milk production will reduce. 
- Failure to provide proper and sufficient water for livestock not only affects production, it may be an animal welfare offence.
- Mangers must provide enough good quality water to meet the needs of the animal.

## Water salinity
- Excessive salinity in livestock drinking water can reduce production. 
- High levels of specific ions in water can cause animal health problems and death.

# Microbiological contaminants
## 
```{r cyanobacteria, fig.cap="Natural toxins originating from cyanobacteria are a primary concern in drinking water for livestock.", echo = FALSE,  out.width="100%", out.height="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cyanobacteria.jpg")
```

## Cyanobacteria
- Natural toxins originating from cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are a primary concern in drinking water for livestock. 
- Cyanobacteria is a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis. 
- Cyanobacteria are known to produce acute hepatotoxins, cytotoxins, neurotoxins, and toxins causing the gastrointestinal diseases. 

## Cyanobacteria
- However, **heavy cyanobacteria growth does not necessarily mean high levels of toxin.** The trigger for cyanobacteria to produce toxins is not completely understood. 
- If the cyanobacteria growth is not of the *Microcystis* species, there is a low probability of having high toxin levels. 
- It is recommended that water contaminated with cyanobacteria should be avoided until the level of toxins is determined or until the water is treated. 

## Pathogens 
- A variety of microbial pathogens can be transmitted to livestock from drinking water sources contaminated. 
- The pathogens of greatest concern in water supplies for farm animals include enteric bacteria such as *E. coli*, *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter jejuni*. 
- Other bacterial diseases known to affect livestock that may be transmitted through water supplies include *Leptospira, Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) pseudomallei*, and *Clostridium botulinum*. 

## Pathogens 
- **The cause of biological contamination of water sources is associated with the animal industry itself**. 
- For instance, in the situation of intensive livestock operation, the risk of water source contamination with animal waste may be very high.

# Water treatment technologies

## Water treatment technologies
- Water contaminants can be decreased considerably or even completely eliminated by a variety of treatment methods. 
- Some methods are more effective than others, but for treating water for livestock consumption, economics are an important issue. 

##

```{r carbon-filter, fig.cap="Activated carbon filters.", echo = FALSE,  out.width="100%", out.height="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/activated-carbon-filter.jpg")
```

## Activated carbon filters
- **This method is based on passing water through a filter containing activated carbon granules.** 
- Contaminants attach to the granules and are removed. 
- Chlorine, some organic compounds associated with coloration, odour and offtaste of water, mercury, some pesticides and volatile organic compounds can be removed by this method. 
- The filters must be inspected and replaced frequently. 
- Poor filter maintenance will decrease effectiveness, and may result in bacterial growth on the filter, causing potential contamination of the water with pathogens. 

## Air stripping

- **Air stripping is the transferring of volatile components of a liquid into an air stream.** 
- It is an environmental engineering technology used for the purification of groundwaters and wastewaters containing volatile compounds. 
- Contaminants are transferred from water to air and vented off. This method may be effective in removing hydrogen sulphide, some odours and tastes, and some volatile organic chemicals.

knitr::include_graphics("figures/Air-Stripper.png")
```

## Biological filters
- Biological filtration is a natural process that takes place in rivers, streams, and oceans. 
- Bacteria eat certain compounds, like ammonia, which is broken down into byproducts that are not toxic.  
- This method is effective at removing iron, arsenic, and organics. 
- A microbiological layer is used to filter and consume contaminants.

## 
```{r swimming-pool, fig.cap="A swimming pool which treated chloride.", echo = FALSE,  out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/swimming-pool.jpeg")
```

## Chlorination
- This is one of **the most common methods in water treatment** for pathogen reduction in drinking water for livestock. 
- Chlorination is much more effective if it follows a filtration system to remove large particles that can house bacteria. 
- In particular, this is an effective and widely used method to kill many kinds of microorganisms in water. 
- Chlorine content of the treated water should be monitored because the high concentrations of chlorine released to the animal water system may affect water intake and productivity.

## Ozonation  
- This method of water treatment is based on application of ozone gas. 
- Ozone is a very potent oxidizing agent, and destroys pathogenic microorganisms. 
- It can reduce color, improves taste, odor, kills bacteria, viruses, oxidize iron, manganese, cyanide, phenol, benzene, chlorophenol, atrazine, nitrobenzene and other pollutants. 
- The equipment typically is quite expensive.

# Importance of clean water to mankind

```

##
- **Safe and readily available water is important for public health**. 
- Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction.

##
- **Billions of people have gained access to water, but huge inequalities remain.** 
- In 2015, 71% of the global population (5.2 billion people) used a safely managed drinking-water service (available when needed, and free from contamination). 
- 89% of the global population (6.5 billion people) used at least a basic service. A basic service is an improved drinking-water source within a round trip of 30 minutes to collect water. 

##
- 844 million people lack even a basic drinking-water service, including 159 million people who are dependent on surface water. 
- Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces.

##
```{r dirty-water, fig.cap="", echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("extra/dirty-water.png")
```

##
- Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio. 
- Inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks. 
- Some 842,000 people are estimated to die each year from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe drinking-water, sanitation, and hand hygiene.

# Livestock and sustainable management of water
##
- **Agriculture uses approximately 70% of the available freshwater supply**, and roughly 30% of global agricultural water goes on livestock production (Ran et al., 2016).
- **The largest proportion is associated with the production of feed.**

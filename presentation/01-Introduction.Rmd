## Introduction

- All living creatures constantly interact with the environment. 
- To understanding individual animals, we have to understand the relationship they have with their environment. 
- Also, animals affect the environment. 
- From birth to death, an animal generates carbon dioxide, methane, feces, and urine. 
- The excretes from the animal are built with molecules such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, and are recycled within and between ecosystems.

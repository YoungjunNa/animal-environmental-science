## Adaptation
> "Changes in morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and behavioral characteristics of the animal which promote welfare and favor survival in a specific environment." --- Hafez  

Hafez defined an adaptation as above. The adaptation helps an animal survive in their external environment. 
The representative adaptive traits are:

  1. Structural adaptation
  2. Behavioral adaptation
  3. Physiological adaptation

## 

- **Structural** adaptation is the changes in physical features (e.g. body shape, skin, and internal organs) of the animal. 
- **Behavioral** adaptation is the changes in behaviors (e.g. searching for food, mating, vocalizations, and mitigation) of the animal. 
- **Physiological** adaptation is the changes in the animal body functions such as growth, temperature regulation, and ionic balance. 
- Sometimes, adapted animal create a new species (*speciation*).

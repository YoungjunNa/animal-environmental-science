\chapter*{Welcome}\label{welcome}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Welcome}

This is the website for \textbf{``Animal environmental science''}. To
understanding individual animals, we have to understand the relationship
they have with their environment. This book will introduce the
interaction between animals and the environment.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

\includegraphics[width=0.49000\textwidth,height=2.91667in]{figures/polar.jpeg}

All living creatures constantly interact with the environment. To
understanding individual animals, we have to understand the relationship
they have with their environment. Basically, animals can find food,
shelter, protection, and mates from the environment called
\textbf{habitat}. The animal habitat includes both phisical (non-living)
and biotic (livinig) components (see Table \ref{tab:habitat}).

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:habitat}Components of habitat (physical and biotic)}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}
\toprule
Physical & Biotic\\
\midrule
Temperature & Plant matter\\
Humidity & Predators\\
Oxygen & Parasites\\
Wind & Competitors\\
Soil & Individuals of the same species\\
\addlinespace
Light intensity & \\
Elevation & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Animal habitat is constantly changed over time. Not only natural
disasters (Eruption of volcano, earthquake, tsunami, and wildfire), also
human activity can affect the animal habitat. Unlike the wildlife, the
environment of domesticated animals (such as cow, pig, poultry, and dog)
that raised in facility are controlled by the human. Because it's a very
huge field, this book can't cover every topic of both wildlife and
domesticated animal. Thus, from now on, we will deal with the topic for
the domesticated animal.

\chapter{Animal and environment}\label{chapter2}

\section{External environment}\label{external-environment}

Animal never separates from the stimuli from outside. In the domestic
animals, the external environment includes both physical (e.g.~housing,
feeder, paddock, fence, and noise) and biotic (e.g.~human, mate, and
feed ingredients) components like those of animal habitat \ref{intro}.

\section{Internal environment}\label{internal-environment}

\begin{quote}
``The living body, though it has need of the surrounding environment, is
nevertheless relatively independent of it.'' --- Claude Bernard
\end{quote}

Higher animals have complex organ systems that respond to stimuli to
perform their essential body functions. When the animal recieves the
signals from the sensory organs, they produce a local reflex action
and/or react in the central nervous system. Weak signals produce no
responses, but strong stimuli changes the physiological or behavioral
status of the animal.

\subsection{Law of tolerance}\label{law-of-tolerance}

\begin{quote}
``Each and every species is able to exist and reproduce successfully
only within a definite range of environmental conditions.'' --- Ronald
Good
\end{quote}

Although external environments are continuously changed, if animals in
the normal status, \textbf{they keep the composition of the
extracellular fluid (internal environment) constant to maintain their
live}. We call it \emph{homeostasis}.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:homeostasis}List of homeostatic control variables}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
\toprule
Control variables\\
\midrule
Core temperature; Blood glucose; Iron levels; Copper regulation; Levels of blood gases; Blood oxygen content; Arterial blood pressure; Calcium levels; Sodium concentration; Potassium concentration; Fluid balance; Blood pH; Cerebrospinal fluid; Neurotransmission; Neuroendocrine system; Gene regulation; and Energy balance\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

However, the capacity of to maintain the homeostasis is broken when the
animals let the harsh environments, and differ by their species. Animals
may be limited in their growth and their occurrence by the minimum,
maximum, and optimum condition (Shelford's law of tolerance; Fig.
\ref{fig:law-of-tol})).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{AES_files/figure-latex/law-of-tol-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:law-of-tol}Shelford's law of tolerance}
\end{figure}

The range of the optimum may differ for different processes within the
same organism, and it is not necessarily fixed. They can change as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Seasons change.
\item
  Environmental conditions change.
\item
  Life stage of the organism changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adaptation}\label{adaptation}

Hafez (1968) define the adaptation as below.

\begin{quote}
``Changes in morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and
behavioral characteristics of the animal which promote welfare and favor
survival in a specific environment.'' --- Hafez

# Temperature  
Temperature is a quantity expressing of the amount of heat. Because a rate of every chemical reaction occurs in the animal's body is affected by the temperature, it is a very important factor to all animals. Like most chemical reactions, an enzyme-catalyzed reaction rate in the animal's body increases as the temperature is raised. 

<!-- The molecular structure of enzyme is broken -->
<!-- However, as the high temperature breaks the structure of the enzyme,  -->
<!-- On the other hand, lower temperatures lead to slower chemical reactions.  -->
<!-- In the case of enzymatic reactions, this is complicated by the fact that many enzymes are adversely affected by high temperatures.  -->
